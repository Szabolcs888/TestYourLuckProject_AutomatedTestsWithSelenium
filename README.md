## TestYourLuck_Project

#### This project is the automated testing repository of the TestYourLuck team project of the Progmatic Academy's Automated Testing course (2023-24).

To run the tests in which the user is logged in, you need a "resources" folder inside the "main" folder and a userData.txt file inside it. In the txt, the username must be written in the first line, and the password in the second.

In the txt, the username must be written in the first line, the password in the second, and the name of the browser in which we want to run the tests in the third. The three available browsers are: Firefox, Chrome, Edge. Firefox is set by default (if the third line is empty, the tests will still run with Firefox).

Example: 
>TestElek<br/>
>ki7%34aQ<br/>
>Chrome
